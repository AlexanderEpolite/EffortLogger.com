	"We need to understand the pots of gold out there that maybe took some time and pain how to discover and how to leverage. And we need to recognize the black holes, and lets be very clear where the event horizon is, because once you cross over that line, there be dragons.",
	"Great technology must deliver much more than just a tactical advantage in the marketplace. Society needs strategically sustainable, secure, and useful system solutions, worthy of trust, that typically depend upon a complex ecosystem of organizations and professionals. This ecosystem must be able to ethically design, develop, deliver, operate, support, sustain, and enhance solutions of great societal value. Crucial systems quality attributes must include security, privacy, and reliability, while being worthy of trust. It is no longer good enough for academics to assert that they deliver graduates with knowledge of enduring value, or for businesspeople to say our employees have best college credentials. Our workforce must have and be able to effectively and ethically leverage and employ the knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, tools, technologies, supervision, leadership, and organizational culture needed to serve society, especially in times of overload and stress. This is only possible when all key stakeholders create a safe, healthy, and sustainable environment for excellent performance, continuous improvement, and respect for the contribution of all the incredibly diverse workers needed at every level.",
